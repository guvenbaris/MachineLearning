# Machine Learning

>Different machine learning methods are used in this repository. It contains more than one sample notebook for these methods.

**The methods in the repository are**: 

  * Image Processing (Convolitonal Neural Network)
  * Classification Algorithms
  * Exploratory Data Analysis
  * Natural Language Processing
  * Recommender systems

>If we explain briefly the methods used here:

**CNN(Convolitonal Neural Network):** In deep learning, a convolutional neural network (CNN, or ConvNet) is a class of deep neural networks, most commonly applied to analyzing visual imagery. They are also known as shift invariant or space invariant artificial neural networks (SIANN), based on the shared-weight architecture of the convolution kernels that shift over input features and provide translation equivariant responses. Counter-intuitively, most convolutional neural networks are only equivariant, as opposed to invariant, to translation. They have applications in image and video recognition, recommender systems, image classification, image segmentation, medical image analysis, natural language processing, brain-computer interfaces, and financial time series.[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network)

**Classification Algorithms:** Classification can be performed on structured or unstructured data. Classification is a technique where we categorize data into a given number of classes. The main goal of a classification problem is to identify the category/class to which a new data will fall under. In this section used lots of classification algorithm these are: 

  * *Gaussian Naive Bayes Algorithm 
  * *Decision Tree Classifier
  * *Random Forest Classifier
  * *XGB Classifier
  * *LGBM Classifier
  * *CatBoost Classifier
  * *K-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm
  * *Support Vector Algorithm

**Exploratory Data Analysis:** In statistics, exploratory data analysis is an approach of analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics, often using statistical graphics and other data visualization methods. A statistical model can be used or not, but primarily EDA is for seeing what the data can tell us beyond the formal modeling or hypothesis testing task. Exploratory data analysis was promoted by John Tukey to encourage statisticians to explore the data, and possibly formulate hypotheses that could lead to new data collection and experiments. EDA is different from initial data analysis (IDA).[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploratory_data_analysis)

**Natural Language Processing:** Natural language processing (NLP) is a subfield of linguistics, computer science, and artificial intelligence concerned with the interactions between computers and human language, in particular how to program computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data. The result is a computer capable of "understanding" the contents of documents, including the contextual nuances of the language within them. The technology can then accurately extract information and insights contained in the documents as well as categorize and organize the documents themselves.[3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing)

**Recommender System:** A recommender system, or a recommendation system (sometimes replacing 'system' with a synonym such as platform or engine), is a subclass of information filtering system that seeks to predict the "rating" or "preference" a user would give to an item. Recommender systems are used in a variety of areas, with commonly recognised examples taking the form of playlist generators for video and music services, product recommenders for online stores, or content recommenders for social media platforms and open web content recommenders. These systems can operate using a single input, like music, or multiple inputs within and across platforms like news, books, and search queries. There are also popular recommender systems for specific topics like restaurants and online dating. Recommender systems have also been developed to explore research articles and experts, collaborators, and financial services.[4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recommender_system)
